Token Swap Dapp
The Token Swap Dapp is a decentralized application (Dapp) built on Ethereum that facilitates token swapping directly on the blockchain. This project aims to provide users with a secure and efficient platform for exchanging Ethereum-based tokens without the need for intermediaries.

Features
Token Swapping: Users can swap one ERC-20 token for another directly from their Ethereum wallet.
Decentralized: The Dapp operates entirely on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and security for token swaps.
User-Friendly Interface: The Dapp includes an intuitive and responsive user interface for a seamless trading experience.
Scalability: Utilizes scalability solutions like Arbitrum to enhance transaction throughput and reduce gas fees for token swaps.

How It Works
Connect Wallet: Users connect their Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the Dapp.
Select Tokens: Choose the tokens to swap and specify the amount for each token.
Confirm Swap: Review the transaction details and confirm the swap.
Execute Swap: Execute the swap transaction directly on the Ethereum blockchain.
Transaction Confirmation: Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain, and the swapped tokens will be transferred to the user's wallet.
